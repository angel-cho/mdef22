                        Processing - a tool to create user interfaces via normal media of a computer and organize communication between different devices based on the Java programming language.
                        P5.js - a web-based tool for creating user interface and creative coding, based on JavaScript.
                        Blender - can do 'everything'. has a python interface that's powerful.
                        MIT App Inventor - an easy open source tool to create phone applications.
                        A Frame - open source tool used for prototyping VR and AR environments.
                        Node Red - flow-based development tool for visual programming, tools for controlling dataflows in a graphic way, has modules for building dashboards.

                        Python or JavaScript
                        Python is recommended for wider applications and can be a more accessible language to learn.
                        Javascript is recommended for mostly web-based.

                        <h3>Serial Communications</h3>
                        Key things to consider:
                        what do I send and how do I send it?
                        how do you prepare your data?
                        which type of data are you sending?
                        which protocol will you use?

                        Formats that are designed to structure data
                        CSB - comma separated value
                        Its important to learn the different formats in order to accomodate for different types of data

                        Best practices
                        - send the least and most meaningful data as you can (controversial for companies who's business is based on data)
                        - this increasses speed and respects privacy of the data owner
                        - based on the objective of the systems
                        - structure your data as simple as you can

                        EXERCISE

                        <h3>Blender</h3>
                        Blender can be used with pyhon
                        create digital twins (ie. mimic the growth of plants digitally)
                        how to use python within blender

                        pyhton is an interpresed language, can give instruction to computer in real time, which is why it's called script and not code
                        this is why there is a console

                        Object oriented programming - a "thing" with properties and abilites that you can interact with (ie. what is your size? change your size. apply something to another object)

                        bpy = blender python (the basic object)
                        "name of the object" dot "the name of the thing you want to access"
                        "cube = bpy.data.objects['Cube']"
                      --> asks blender to give object in data sgructure called 'Cube'
                        stored in a variable called cube

                        python has an 'autocomplete' function. use tab

                        API - a way for the software to expose all the functions of (an object)
