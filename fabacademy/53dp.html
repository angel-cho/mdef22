                      <h1 class="mt-4">3D Printing & Scanning</h1>
                        We learned that 3D printing is an additive manufacturing technique, and despite its name, it's not technically printing in three-dimensions, but rather layering 2D planes to create a 3D form.
                        I was surprised to learn that the first 3D printing technique was patented as learly as 1983.
                        Due to the patent, the technology was kept behind hidden doors until 2005, when the patent expired and Andrian Bowter took figured out how to use the technology to build more machines (using machine to build create machines).
                          <br>
                          <br>
                        We touched upon the topic of patents and explored the ways they are both good and bad for makers and the industry.
                        While they give opportunities for funding and development of new techniques, they also limit the growth of technology.
                        It's interetsing to learn about the variations of "openness" of knowledge and tools that allow for different situations.
                        And how much the intention of the creator influences not only design decisions but also the rights and actions.

                        Eduard from Fab Academy and I tested out 3D scanning using the X-box kinnect.
                        We scanned a tinned robot that was sitting on the shelf of the Fab Academy room, and placed it on a white piece of paper.
                        Although the textures of the graphics (output) were very bumpy and collag-y, the scanning abilities were quite impressive.
                        I think the texture didn't bother me as much, because I don't have many other 3D scanning references to compare to, and I didn't expect it to look high-quality.
                        The 3D scanning was appealing to me because it has the potential to be portable.
                        I thought of some ideas to scan spaces and objects around the neighborhood.
