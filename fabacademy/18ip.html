                        We started with a discussion on the different rights, ownership, values, and the concepts behind it.
                        Putting these concepts into practice, we jumped into a group exercise to speculate the possible futures of the Smart Citizen Kit.
                        The Smart Citizen Kit is an open source device and platform developed by Fab Lab Barcelona, that enables citizens to measure, collect, and share different types of data (ie. air polution) from their environment.
                        The exercise was to come up with a creative (or radical) business plan that would sustain the project in the long term.
                        Our group explored a spectrum of solutions that explored low-risk to more radical strategies including marketing, community building, involving local governments, and expanding into blockchain and metaverse.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                            <img src="../imgs/faw18-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:500px;height:;">
                          <br>
                          <br>
                        The plan was to team up with climate activist and environmental justice influencers in marketing the Smart Citizen Kit as not just a useful device for interested people, but an essential right as a citizen.
                        The influencers will revamp the brand identity and bring the SCK to people who may have not previously been interested.
                        The next step would be to take the SCK on a global scale, teaming up with local governments and Fab labs from different parts of the world to build "add ons" or additional parts that would be most useful to them in their contexts.
                        This would add on to the value of open-source, and encourage diversity of making and meaning.
                        SCK would not only promote a device, but also provide educational content on how to use it, how to hack it, how to customize it for individuals.
                        Finally, the most radical idea would be to bring SCK into the world of metaverse, blockchain, and crypto.
                        Using digital twins of our cities in the metaverse to gamify the experience of "taking action" against environmental crises, the digital citizens will be able to ear points which could be used to initiate real-life change with organizations.
