                      Craft traditions have been formed around local resources, materials, and land for thousands of years past. These ancient techniques have transformed our cultures and ways of life for centuries.
                      Within these past few generations, the world has become hyper-globalized, industrialized, and digitized.
                      Not only does this take a heavy impact on the environment and natural resources, but also transforms our connection and the stories with the material world.
                      Our materials and tools are changing due to the process of production, lack of resources, and changing climates.
                      Drawing inspiration from ancient knowledge systems of the world, we reflect on how these past traditions can be used to imagine and speculate on the rituals of our future, asking questions such as:

                      What would pottery look like when our soils are contaminated with nuclear waste?
                      What would food look like when we have depleted the land of farming?

                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Project Outline:
                        <ol>
                          <li>Using a traditional craft process or object from different indigenous cultures (N. America, Korea, Lebanon) and a current weak signal from the same part of the world, create a speculative tool for dining.</li>
                          <li>Speculate on the changing ecologies of our local lands and planet through the common activity of eating.</li>
                          <li>Investigate the effects of climate crisis and human intervention (ie. New soil compositions due to waste and chemicals, plastic waste in the ocean, etc.)</li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                      In researching the weak signals and current crises in Korea, I found a few topics that would be interesting including nuclear waste management and air pollution.
                      Both are big issues that Korean is currently dealing with and which has a great impact on the land and people.
                      I spent the first day making resarch on these crises, their effects on the environment, and imagining scenarios that might occur in the future if these crises were exaggerated.
                      I focused first on the nuclear waste crises, and imagined a scenario where the underground burrying method fails, and radioactive waste leaks into the earth.
                      This will cause the soil to be contaminated, and the clay used for ceramic tableware will be toxic.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                      Expanding on this concept, I sketched a design for a plate that is made of ceramics on top with silicone on the bottom.
                      The plate has holes of different scales, where the silicone will inflate out of. The idea was to create a plate where the food doesn't touch the contaminated clay.
                      I also wanted to combine raw and synthetic materials to create a hybrid look that embraced both past and future.

                      The form of the plate was an interpretation of some images of radioactive and toxic soils.
                      Since I wanted to try slip casting, I had the idea to first 3D print the positive, create the mold with plaster, then cast with slip.
                      I made the 3D print with PET fillament, which took 9hrs to print.
                      Within this process, I neglected to remember the "soft to hard" rule in molding and casting, and that my 3D print will likely get stuck in the plaster.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                      While the 3D print was running, I made the laser cut parts to cast the silicone.
