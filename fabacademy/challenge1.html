                        For this first micro challenge, I teamed up with Vikrant and Busi.
                        Upon our initial ven diagram exercise, we discovered our common interests were on design impact, data visualization, storytelling, indigenous practices, and gamification.
                        We talked about ways to combine these interests and decided we would design a board game that includes some of these topics.
                          <br>
                        Vikrant and I spent almost two full days of the challenge working out the concept of the game, how it should be played, and what it should look like.
                        The more we discussed, the more we realized that creating a board game from scratch in four days was a lot more difficult than we initially thought.
                        And by the end of the second day, we decided to agree on a simplified concept so we can start prototyping.
                        The concept was a board game as a tool for MDEF (and other) designers to collaboratively generate ideas together.
                          <br>
                        The premise of the game was ...
                        The form was inspired by sacred geometry and the pieces would fit togehter to create a physical artifact from the ideas that were discussed.
                          <br>
                        Once we agreed on the general devided up the work so we could be efficient in the last two days.
                        I made the text and categories for the pieces to place on the geometry Vikrant had made.

                        "Wisdom Cards" that were principles or practices based on non-Western traditions.
                        For example, there was the "Yin Yang" card, inspired by cultures of the Far East, that promted ""

                        It was also my task to create the press-fit joints on Rhino 3D.
                        But since the geometry was made in illustrator then exported into Rhino, I found the shapes to be inconsistent and slightly varying.
                        Because of this, I had to make all the joints manually for each piece of the game, making the task take a long time.
                        I realized the process would have gone smoother if we had started in Rhino to begin with.
                          <br>
                        We also ran into many problems with prototyping and laser cutting with MDF.
