                    <h1 class="mt-4">New Way of Documenting</h1>
                      Unfortunately, documenting my work has become an afterthought during these first few months of the program. I’ve been deeply engaged in learning new things and haven’t found a great way to integrate documentation into my process. I have been taking photographs as I remember to, and try to do it quickly so I don’t disturb the flow of the activity. But when I return to these photos at the end of the week for my reflections, I find they are inconsistent and require time to sort through to find a narrative structure. The same goes for my end of the week reflections on my website. I realize there’s a disconnect between my weekly experiences and my documentation and communication of them.
                      <br>
                      Moving forward, I would like to create a system for documenting that is non-intrusive to my process while representing my work in a way that feels authentic. I love the idea that documenting can be a part of the work itself and not an additional task. I’m interested in exploring different documenting methods (active, passive, sound, visual, using different tools) to see which resonates most and if it makes sense to combine a few. Most importantly, the system has to be intuitive (not take too much extra effort) and also accessible to others in the end. I can imagine that some of these experiments sound interesting, but may not prove to be sustainable.
                      <br>
                      Ideas of documenting methods I'd like to explore: voice recordings to my future self, biometric data via apple watch, strict system to take photos, and screen recordings.

                    <h3>Documenting Tech Beyond the Myth</h3>
                      During these two weeks I took many videos, sound recordings and images. I didn't have a concrete idea of the outcome, but I wanted to have options to play around with. Looking over the media I've collected, I became interested in the audio clips of machines and people. In the final documentation, I decided to play with sound in a way that reflected the chatoric and fast-paced learnings in the past two weeks.
