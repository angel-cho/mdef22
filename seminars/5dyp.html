                    <h1 class="mt-4">New Way of Documenting</h1>
                      Through this workshop, I realized that documenting my process has become an afterthought during these first few months of the program.
                      As my attention is fully focused on learning new information, I don't think to step out of that zone to snap a photo or video.
                      The idea of finding a documentation method that is more a part of my process instead of a secondary process is very appealing to me.
                      And Kate's challenge of imagining different methods of documenting my experience is something I'm looking forward to exploring.
                      <br><br>
                      Moving forward, I would like to create a system for documenting that is non-intrusive to my process while representing my work in a way that feels authentic. I love the idea that documenting can be a part of the work itself and not an additional task. Iâ€™m interested in exploring different documenting methods (active, passive, sound, visual, using different tools) to see which resonates most and if it makes sense to combine a few. Most importantly, the system has to be intuitive (not take too much extra effort) and also accessible to others in the end. I can imagine that some of these experiments sound interesting, but may not prove to be sustainable.
                      Some ideas of documenting methods I'd like to explore:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Recorindg voice memos to my future self</li>
                          <li>Using biometric data from my apple watch</li>
                          <li>Creating a strict system to take photos</li>
                          <li>Using screen recordings for process videos</li>
                        </ul>
                      <br>
                    <h3>Documenting Tech Beyond the Myth</h3>
                      During these two weeks I took many videos, sound recordings and images. I didn't have a concrete idea of the outcome, but I wanted to have options to play around with. Looking over the media I've collected, I became interested in the audio clips of machines and people. In the final documentation, I decided to play with sound in a way that reflected the chatoric and fast-paced learnings in the past two weeks.
