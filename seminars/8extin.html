                    <h1 class="mt-4">Extended Intelligences</h1>
                        <p>
                          This week we learned about machine learning and artificial intelligence with members of the collective Taller Estampa.
                          We started with an introduction to artificial intelligence and the way neural networks, datasets, and the training process works.
                          This process peaked my interest and I had many questions
                          <br><br>
                          In our assignment, we had to take 100 photos of Poblenou (old and new) and 100 photos that were last taken on our phones. We were assured that our photos will be shown as low resolution.
                          Overnight, Pau input our data to train the image sorting neural network in order to present the results to us in the next couple days.
                          The images below show the outcome of this training.
                          <br><br>

                          <br><br>
                          In the following days, we experimented with multiple Google Colabs including image identification, latent space, and deep fake.
                          The results were very interesting but the process still remained mysterious, since the notebook was already made step by step for us to press play and execute.
                          It seemed like there were many unanswerable questions with how the deep neural network makes decisions.

                      <h3>Speculative AI Design</h3>
                        <p>
                          For our speculative design project, our group decided to work with food from around world.
                          We wanted to create a tool using AI that can generate original recipes using components of recipes from cultures around the world.
                          In addition to the recipe, we wanted to add a feature for the AI to suggest local ingredients as a substitution.
                          We determined that we would need two datasets based on text: recipes from around the world and local ingredients from every country. And one image dataset of pictures of cooked dishes.
                          Then we would train the selected neural network to classify and separate the text from the ingredients and the another neural network to classify the ingredients from the images.
                          From this, the AI will create a new recipe from user selected countries on the map and be able to create a visual representation of it.
