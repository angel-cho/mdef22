                        In our first week of MDEF program, we met the faculties, visited the facilities and the Poblenou neighborhood, and was introduced to the structure of the program.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h3>The Future</h3>
                          <p>
                          “Today we are going to talk about the future”, and all of the baggage that comes along with it. Who are we? Which future? What are we talking about? Listening to Mariana’s personal journey, I resonated with her insight in discovering human metaphors behind all aspects of technology. The example of the ancient memory board artifact was especially fascinating because it was so visually and conceptually similar to the circuit boards we make today. It made me feel humble and a part of something larger, in an ancestral lineage of humans that are working to create and preserve their stories.

                        <h3>Design Space</h3>
                          <p>
                          We were introduced to our design spaces on Miro, a working space we will be using throughout the program to map out our ideas, findings, experiments, and feedback. We started getting acquainted with this space through a card game. We had to pick a topic card we cared about, then blindly select a series of other topic cards, and create meaningful connections between the cards. Having the pre-written cards were helpful in giving form to abstract ideas. I enjoyed the format of the game, and thought it was a great way to engage and teach a system.

                            <br>
                          <p>
                            On day 2 we went on a hike in Collserola Natural Park, on the outskirts of Barcelona. We were prompted to picked a card to take with us and reflect on during our hike. I chose “Emotional Tech”. I’ve always seen this “green area” on google maps, but haven’t made it out there yet so was excited to explore. Our early morning hike was full of surprises; we explored unmarked trails, tasted wild berries, identified new plants, exchanged ideas, walked in silence, and received a great talk from a park ranger at the peak of our hike. Some reflections from our conversation:
                            <br>
                            - Relationship of the city to the forest. Living in a capitalistic society, we have the tendency to want to build, expand, and grow our citites. But how does this affect the ecosystem and other species that have previously lived in the urban areas or currently live around it?

                            - The significance of seeing something vs “nothing”; for example a forest vs a field. I had never thought about the importance of visual scale in determining our values in this way. The park ranger brought up the topic of humans building on empty fields because they see the empty land as an opportunity to “build on”. In contrast, a forest full of trees and larger species is seen as something to be saved or preserved. But what we don’t realize is that ecosystems and other organisms like birds depend on fields to feed and survive.

                            - How can we discourage people from moving to cities? This was an interesting topic to have post covid, when our view of workspace and home space have shifted tremendously. In the past year, many people have already migrated to the countrysides seeking nature, more space, and since remote work became a long-term possibility.
                          </p>
                        <h3>My card: Emotional Technology</h3>
                            <p>
                              I chose this card because the words resonated with me, but I didn’t actually know its official meaning. After doing some research, I learned that Emotional Tech refers to technology that recognizes and uses human emotions (usually through biometric data) to improve their outputs and services. Some reflections I had during my day with this card:
                              Can we use the input as emotions from other species besides humans? Shift the human-centered perspective
                              How can emo tech improve our relationship with our surroundings
                              The ways we relate to each other in a city environment
                              What do we mean when we say “better” experience or world. Do we define “better” as easier or more convenient? If everything is more convenient, are we missing out on the revelations and discoveries that inconvenience and random curve balls life throws us?
                            </p>
