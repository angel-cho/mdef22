                        <h3>Forensics of the Obsolescence</h3>
                          <p>
                            Exploring the question of what is behind these "black boxes" of technological gadgets we use in our daily lives, we gathered to disect and find out for ourselves. As a class we had the roomba vaccum, large television monitor, Mac laptop and computer, and an electric heater.
                            Our group disassembled a first generation iRobot Roomba self-cleaning vaccum machine. Having owned a self-cleaning vaccum similar to this one, it was interesting to see each of the components that produced the functions.
                            <br><br>
                            It was fascinating to see how many different little parts (mechanic, casings, electronics, screws, plastics) the vaccum was made of.
                            There were four motors, two circuit boards, many infrared sensors, and many touch sensors. Wtih the discovery of every piece, we took time to discuss its use and look up the parts.
                            We concluded that some of these individual components were fairly simple in their function and mechanical composition, but also very complex engineering and producing each component.

                          <p>
                          As a group, we came up with the objective to learn about where our food originates from. Which lead us to the hypothesis: Does the food in Iaac's vending machine come from local sources?
                          We investigated this topic through the webscraping method and gathering data.

                      <h3>Almost Useless Machine</h3>
                        <p>
                        In this last group exercise, our promt was to design a machine without practical function. Our idea was a machine that works in a loop cycle and represents the cycle of waste produced by humans. We pitched our idea to the other groups and they negotiated which components we needed from the "bazaar" (the remninces of parts from the Forensic Obsolescence exercise),
                        and were given two wheels with motors from the roombam, CD motor from a macbook computer, and a button. With these objects, we made a quick sketch of the possibilities of forms and mechanics that will produce a cycle in an interesting and representative way, and got to work.
                        Our machine consisted of two main components: the physical structure where the ball falls through the incline and the robotic arm that picks up the ball and places it on the top of the incline. I helped out on both the electronics and building of the structure. It was interesting to create our flow charts and understand the logic behind the programming of the machine.
                        We first tested the mechanics and programming out with buttons, but managed to automize it for the final filming.
