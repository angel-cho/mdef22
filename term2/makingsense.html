                      <h3>Making Sense and Meaning</h3>
                        In thinking about design, we typically think of man-made systems, tools, devices, graphics, and visuals. But there is also design before and in the absence of humans—the design we speak of when we observe patterns in shape or function in nature often referred to as being ‘by design’. The symmetry in cell reproduction, the fibers of plants, the structure of snowflakes have all been touched by design. Reflecting on these two different meanings, I find it interesting that when we observe design ‘happening’ in nature, we often don’t question who the designer is or what their intention might be. Somehow, we are able to isolate the process of design as a seemingly non-random action that assures some kind of order. In contrast, when we speak of design in the man-made world, the human hand and mind are large components of each decision made.

                          <br>
                        Design has taken on many different meanings throughout the course of my career. I decided to pursue my career in graphic design because I saw it as a way to combine my passions for art and social sciences. I was also fascinated by the practicality of design and how it applied to everything that we observed in the world. In my education design was very much taught as a way of thinking to solve problems, clearly drawing separations from the designer and the problem.  As I continued to study and work as a graphic designer, design became a process of thinking that could be applied to many different mediums and outputs. Starting with print design, I moved on to work as a digital designer, working with motion graphics and videos, exhibition, user experience, and interactive design projects. The more I practiced design, its definition became less clear and more ubiquitous.

                          <br>
                        Holding these various notions of design, I would define design as a process of making connections between various ideas and forms in a structured and visible way. I would also add that design is happening all the time with or without us. And the value of design for me lies in its transformative power. I have come to realize that with each design process, we form a new way of seeing and relating to our world, transforming our values and experiences. This holds true not only when we sit down to consciously ‘design something’, but in every decision we make in designing our realities.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                        In these past few months of the masters program, I gained the understanding of design not only as a way to solve problems, but also as problematic. As designers, we often see the world “out there” as existing separately from us, in our design studios. This dualistic perspective becomes problematic because it separates the subjective from the world, while the notions of these two are interconnected. I truly believe that design has the ability to transform, and transformation can improve the condition of shared lives on this planet. However, I’m not so confident that we have control to make this transformation positive.
