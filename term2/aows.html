  I was interested in the philosophical explorations we discussed in this class. We explored the range of topics related to the systems in society; labour, capital, surveillance, social media, and life in the 21st century. Diving deeper into how these topics intertwine, we discussed their connection and role within our daily lives. I found these topics very relevant, as I am interested in investigating the interconnections of design, objects, nature, and systems. All of the weak signals in today’s world from climate change, commerce, social media, to nationalities; can not be understood in isolation from one another.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also interesting to hear the many different perspectives of these topics within our class. As we investigated seemingly simple questions such as “what is a job?”, we revealed the complexity of these topics. I think each of us are affected by our  social and familial contexts, and in this way have our subjective definitions. As we discussed the main systemic structures which have objectively impacted these ways of thinking, it was interesting to start making connections with our individual context.
  <br>
  <br>
  I believe context is key because it reveals the multifaceted agents within a single issue, and helps provide a clearer perspective. In the class, this complexity was demonstrated when we were asked a simple question, “where are you from?”. Not a single person had a straightforward or simple answer and not one place was un-impacted by another place in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  For me, this class raised more questions than answers, which was a valuable moment to stop and reflect on the what’s and why’s of all all the making we are doing during this term.
  <br>
  <br>
  <ul>
  Key learnings from this course:
  <li>The creation and evolution of values within society</li>
  <li>Contextual understanding of a single weak signal</li>
  <li>Understanding the impacts of large social systems and agents and how to use this knowledge to make ‘better’ decisions</li>
  </ul>
